                        Sorting algorithms were always difficult for me to understand. I created this tool to
                         to help me better grasp their nature by visualing the process. This project definitely gave me more 
                         confidence with understanding algorithms.

                        I've always had a fascination with game development, so I set out to create a small game demo that could eventually become a standalone web-supported project.
                        The world of game engines offered several choices, including Unreal, Godot, LibGDX, and Solar2D.
                        In the end, I chose Unity because of its well-documented features and the abundance of online learning resources.
                        My initial project idea was a simple space shooter, meant to help me get understand Unity's game development workflow.
                        However, it quickly became apparent that game development is much more complex than I initially thought.
                        Developing on Unity introduced me to new concepts like component-based architecture, where game objects are made up of different components that work together.
                        I also learned about event-driven programming, which is central to Unity, as it relies heavily on events and event handlers to manage game events,
                        user input, and physics. I also discovered Unity Web which is a deployment option that compiles the game to WebGL. With this, I was able to
                        embed the game into this website without any other installations or plugins. Navigating this different workflow was challenging, but I found an abundance of online resources that helped me throughout this learning journey.

                        After studying endangered primates in my anthropology class, I decided to create a webpage dedicated to one special species:
                        the golden snub-nosed monkey. This project enhanced my CSS skills and improved the presentation of websites. Specifically, I learned about parallax scrolling and bootstrap 4.
                        I also learned how to use the Sheridan College domain to host webpages.
                        Did you know these monkeys are known to engage in snowball fights? They form and throw snowballs just like humans.
